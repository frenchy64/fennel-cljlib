# Cljlib (v1.1.1)
Fennel-cljlib - functions from Clojure's core.clj implemented on top of Fennel.

This library contains a set of functions providing functions that behave similarly to Clojure's equivalents.
The library itself apart from macros has nothing Fennel-specific, so it should work on Lua, e.g.:

``` lua
Lua 5.3.5  Copyright (C) 1994-2018 Lua.org, PUC-Rio
> clj = require"cljlib"
> table.concat(clj.mapv(function (x) return x * x end, {1, 2, 3}), " ")
-- 1 4 9
```

This example is mapping an anonymous `function` over a table, producing a new table, and concatenating it with `" "`.

However, this library also provides a Fennel-specific set of [macros](./macros.md), which provides additional facilities like [`defn`](#defn) or [`defmulti`](#defmulti) which extends the language allowing writing code that looks and works mostly like Clojure.

Each function in this library is created with [`defn`](#defn), which is a special macro for creating multi-arity functions.
So when you see a function signature like `(foo [x])`, this means that this is function `foo`, which accepts exactly one argument `x`.
On the contrary, functions created with `fn` will produce a `(foo x)` signature (`x` is not inside brackets).

Functions, which signatures look like `(foo ([x]) ([x y]) ([x y & zs]))`, it is a multi-arity function, which accepts either one, two, or three or more arguments.
Each `([...])` represents a different body of a function which is chosen by checking the amount of arguments passed to the function.
See [Clojure's doc section on multi-arity functions](https://clojure.org/guides/learn/functions#_multi_arity_functions).

## Compatibility

This library is mainly developed with Lua 5.4 and tested against Lua 5.2, 5.3, 5.4, and LuaJIT 2.1.0-beta3.
Note, that in Lua 5.2 and LuaJIT equality semantics are a bit different from Lua 5.3 and Lua 5.4.
The main difference is that when comparing two tables, they must have exactly the same `__eq` metamethods, so comparing hash sets with hash sets will work, but comparing sets with other tables works only in Lua5.3+.
Another difference is that Lua 5.2 and LuaJIT don't have an inbuilt UTF-8 library, therefore [`seq`](#seq) function will not work for non-ASCII strings.

## `ns`
Function signature:

```
(ns name commentary requirements)
```

Namespace declaration macro.
Accepts the `name` of the generated namespace, and creates a local
variable with this name holding a table. Optionally accepts
`commentary` describing what namespace is about and a `requirements`
spec, specifying what libraries should be required.

The `requirements` spec is a list that consists of vectors, specifying
library name and a possible alias or a vector of names to refer to
without a prefix:

``` fennel
(ns some-namespace
  "Description of the some-namespace."
  (:require [some.lib]
            [some.other.lib :as lib2]
            [another.lib :refer [foo bar baz]]))

(defn inc [x] (+ x 1))
```

Which is equivalent to:

``` fennel
(local some-namespace {})
(local lib (require :some.lib))
(local lib2 (require :some.other.lib))
(local {:bar bar :baz baz :foo foo} (require :another.lib))
(comment "Description of the some-namespace.")
```

Note that when no `:as` alias is given, the library will be named
after the innermost part of the require path, i.e. `some.lib` is
transformed to `lib`.

See `in-ns` on how to switch namespaces.

## `in-ns`
Function signature:

```
(in-ns name)
```

Sets the compile-time variable `cljlib-namespaces` to the given `name`.
Affects such macros as `def`, `defn`, which will bind names to the
specified namespace.

### Examples
Creating several namespaces in the file, and defining functions in each:

``` fennel
(ns a)
(defn f [] "f from a")
(ns b)
(defn f [] "f from b")
(in-ns a)
(defn g [] "g from a")
(in-ns b)
(defn g [] "g from b")

(assert-eq (a.f) "f from a")
(assert-eq (b.f) "f from b")
(assert-eq (a.g) "g from a")
(assert-eq (b.g) "g from b")
```

Note, switching namespaces in the REPL doesn't affect non-namespaced
local bindings.  In other words, when defining a local with `def`, a
bot a local binding and a namespaced binding are created, and
switching current namespace won't change the local binding:

``` fennel
>> (ns foo)
nil
>> (def x 42)
nil
>> (ns bar)
nil
>> (def x 1337)
nil
>> (in-ns foo)
#<namespace: foo>
>> x ; user might have expected to see 42 here
1337
>> foo.x
42
>> bar.x
1337
```

Sadly, Fennel itself has no support for namespace switching in REPL,
so this feature can be only partially emulated by the cljlib library.


## `def`
Function signature:

```
(def ([name initializer]) ([meta name initializer]))
```

Name binding macro similar to `local` but acts in terms of current
namespace set with the `ns` macro, unless `:private` was passed before
the binding name. Accepts the `name` to be bound and the `initializer`
expression. `meta` can be either an associative table where keys are
strings, or a string representing a key from the table. If a sole
string is given, its value is set to `true` in the meta table.

## `fn*`
Function signature:

```
(fn* ([name doc-string? [params*] pre-post? body]) ([name doc-string? ([params*] pre-post? body) +]))
```

Clojure-inspired `fn` macro for defining functions.
Accepts an optional `name` and `docstring?`, followed by the binding
list containing function's `params*`. The `body` is wrapped in an
implicit `do`.  The `doc-string?` argument specifies an optional
documentation for the function.  Supports multi-arity dispatching via
the following syntax:

(fn* optional-name
  optional-docstring
  ([arity1] body1)
  ([other arity2] body2))

Accepts `pre-post?` conditions in a form of a table after argument
list:

(fn* optional-name
  optional-docstring
  [arg1 arg2]
  {:pre  [(check1 arg1 arg2) (check2 arg1)]
   :post [(check1 $) ... (checkN $)]}
  body)

The same syntax applies to multi-arity version.

(pre- and post-checks are not yet implemented)

## `defn`
Function signature:

```
(defn ([name doc-string? [params*] pre-post? body]) ([name doc-string? ([params*] pre-post? body) +]))
```

Same as `(def name (fn* name docstring? [params*] pre-post? exprs*))`
or `(def name (fn* name docstring? ([params*] pre-post? exprs*)+))`
with any doc-string or attrs added to the function metadata.  Accepts
`name` which will be used to refer to a function in the current
namespace, and optional `doc-string?`, a vector of function's
`params*`, `pre-post?` conditions, and the `body` of the function.
The body is wrapped in an implicit do.  See `fn*` for more info.

## `defn-`
Function signature:

```
(defn- ([name doc-string? [params*] pre-post? body]) ([name doc-string? ([params*] pre-post? body) +]))
```

Same as `(def :private name (fn* name docstring? [params*] pre-post?
exprs*))` or `(def :private name (fn* name docstring? ([params*]
pre-post?  exprs*)+))` with any doc-string or attrs added to the
function metadata. Accepts `name` which will be used to refer to a
function, and optional `doc-string?`, a vector of function's
`params*`, `pre-post?` conditions, and the `body` of the function.
The body is wrapped in an implicit do. See `fn*` for more info.

## `time`
Function signature:

```
(time expr)
```

Measure the CPU time spent executing `expr`.

## `if-let`
Function signature:

```
(if-let [name test] if-branch else-branch)
```

When `test` is logical `true`, evaluates the `if-branch` with `name`
bound to the value of `test`. Otherwise, evaluates the `else-branch`

## `when-let`
Function signature:

```
(when-let [name test] & body)
```

When `test` is logical `true`, evaluates the `body` with `name` bound
to the value of `test`.

## `if-some`
Function signature:

```
(if-some [name test] if-branch else-branch)
```

When `test` is not `nil`, evaluates the `if-branch` with `name`
bound to the value of `test`. Otherwise, evaluates the `else-branch`

## `when-some`
Function signature:

```
(when-some [name test] & body)
```

When `test` is not `nil`, evaluates the `body` with `name` bound to
the value of `test`.

## `defmulti`
Function signature:

```
(defmulti name docstring? dispatch-fn options*)
```

Create multifunction `name` with runtime dispatching based on results
from `dispatch-fn`.  Returns a proxy table with `__call` metamethod,
that calls `dispatch-fn` on its arguments.  Amount of arguments
passed, should be the same as accepted by `dispatch-fn`.  Looks for
multimethod based on result from `dispatch-fn`.

Accepts optional `docstring?`, and `options*` arguments, where
`options*` is a sequence of key value pairs representing additional
attributes.  Supported options:

`:default` - the default dispatch value, defaults to `:default`.

By default, multifunction has no multimethods, see
[`defmethod`](#defmethod) on how to add one.

## `defmethod`
Function signature:

```
(defmethod multi-fn dispatch-value fnspec)
```

Attach new method to multi-function dispatch value. Accepts the
`multi-fn` as its first argument, the `dispatch-value` as second, and
`fnspec` - a function tail starting from argument list, followed by
function body as in [`fn*`](#fn).

### Examples
Here are some examples how multimethods can be used.

#### Factorial example
Key idea here is that multimethods can call itself with different
values, and will dispatch correctly.  Here, `fac` recursively calls
itself with less and less number until it reaches `0` and dispatches
to another multimethod:

``` fennel
(ns test)

(defmulti fac (fn [x] x))

(defmethod fac 0 [_] 1)
(defmethod fac :default [x] (* x (fac (- x 1))))

(assert-eq (fac 4) 24)
```

`:default` is a special method which gets called when no other methods
were found for given dispatch value.

#### Multi-arity dispatching
Multi-arity function tails are also supported:

``` fennel
(ns test)

(defmulti foo (fn* ([x] [x]) ([x y] [x y])))

(defmethod foo [10] [_] (print "I knew I'll get 10"))
(defmethod foo [10 20] [_ _] (print "I knew I'll get both 10 and 20"))
(defmethod foo :default ([x] (print (.. "Umm, got" x)))
                        ([x y] (print (.. "Umm, got both " x " and " y))))
```

Calling `(foo 10)` will print `"I knew I'll get 10"`, and calling
`(foo 10 20)` will print `"I knew I'll get both 10 and 20"`.
However, calling `foo` with any other numbers will default either to
`"Umm, got x"` message, when called with single value, and `"Umm, got
both x and y"` when calling with two values.

#### Dispatching on object's type
We can dispatch based on types the same way we dispatch on values.
For example, here's a naive conversion from Fennel's notation for
tables to Lua's one:

``` fennel
(ns test)

(defmulti to-lua-str (fn [x] (type x)))

(defmethod to-lua-str :number [x] (tostring x))
(defmethod to-lua-str :table [x]
  (let [res []]
    (each [k v (pairs x)]
      (table.insert res (.. "[" (to-lua-str k) "] = " (to-lua-str v))))
    (.. "{" (table.concat res ", ") "}")))
(defmethod to-lua-str :string [x] (.. "\"" x "\""))
(defmethod to-lua-str :default [x] (tostring x))

(assert-eq (to-lua-str {:a {:b 10}}) "{[\"a\"] = {[\"b\"] = 10}}")

(assert-eq (to-lua-str [:a :b :c [:d {:e :f}]])
           "{[1] = \"a\", [2] = \"b\", [3] = \"c\", [4] = {[1] = \"d\", [2] = {[\"e\"] = \"f\"}}}")
```

And if we call it on some table, we'll get a valid Lua table, which we
can then reformat as we want and use in Lua.

All of this can be done with functions, and single entry point
function, that uses if statement and branches on the type, however one
of the additional features of multimethods, is that separate libraries
can extend such multimethod by adding additional claues to it without
needing to patch the source of the function.  For example later on
support for userdata or coroutines can be added to `to-lua-str`
function as a separate multimethods for respective types.

## `cond`
Function signature:

```
(cond ...)
```

Takes a set of test expression pairs. It evaluates each test one at a
time.  If a test returns logical true, `cond` evaluates and returns
the value of the corresponding expression and doesn't evaluate any of
the other tests or exprs. `(cond)` returns nil.

## `loop`
Function signature:

```
(loop binding-vec body*)
```

Recursive loop macro.

Similar to `let`, but binds a special `recur` call that will reassign
the values of the `binding-vec` and restart the loop `body*`.  Unlike
`let`, doesn't support multiple-value destructuring.

The first argument is a binding table with alternating symbols (or destructure
forms), and the values to bind to them.

For example:

``` fennel
(loop [[first & rest] [1 2 3 4 5]
       i 0]
  (if (= nil first)
      i
      (recur rest (+ 1 i))))
```

This would destructure the first table argument, with the first value inside it
being assigned to `first` and the remainder of the table being assigned to
`rest`. `i` simply gets bound to 0.

The body of the form executes for every item in the table, calling `recur` each
time with the table lacking its head element (thus consuming one element per
iteration), and with `i` being called with one value greater than the previous.

When the loop terminates (When the user doesn't call `recur`) it will return the
number of elements in the passed in table. (In this case, 5)

### Limitations

In order to only evaluate expressions once and support sequential
bindings, the binding table has to be transformed like this:

``` fennel
(loop [[x & xs] (foo)
       y (+ x 1)]
  ...)

(let [_1_ (foo)
      [x & xs] _1_
      _2_ (+ x 1)
      y _2_]
  ((fn recur [[x & xs] y] ...) _1_ _2_)
```

This ensures that `foo` is called only once, its result is cached in a
`sym1#` binding, and that `y` can use the destructured value, obtained
from that binding.  The value of this binding is later passed to the
function to begin the first iteration.

This has two unfortunate consequences.  One is that the initial
destructuring happens twice - first, to make sure that later bindings
can be properly initialized, and second, when the first looping
function call happens.  Another one is that as a result, `loop` macro
can't work with multiple-value destructuring, because these can't be
cached as described above.  E.g. this will not work:

``` fennel
(loop [(x y) (foo)] ...)
```

Because it would be transformed to:

``` fennel
(let [_1_ (foo)
      (x y) _1_]
  ((fn recur [(x y)] ...) _1_)
```

`x` is correctly set, but `y` is completely lost.  Therefore, this
macro checks for lists in bindings.

## `try`
Function signature:

```
(try body* catch-clause* finally-clause?)
```

General purpose try/catch/finally macro.
Wraps its body in `pcall` and checks the return value with `match`
macro.

Catch clause is written either as `(catch symbol body*)`, thus acting
as catch-all, or `(catch value body*)` for catching specific errors.
It is possible to have several `catch` clauses.  If no `catch` clauses
specified, an implicit catch-all clause is created.  `body*`, and
inner expressions of `catch-clause*`, and `finally-clause?` are
wrapped in implicit `do`.

The `finally` clause is optional, and written as (finally body*).  If
present, it must be the last clause in the [`try`](#try) form, and the only
`finally` clause.  Note that `finally` clause is for side effects
only, and runs either after succesful run of [`try`](#try) body, or after any
`catch` clause body, before returning the result.  If no `catch`
clause is provided `finally` runs in implicit catch-all clause, and
trows error to upper scope using `error` function.

To throw error from [`try`](#try) to catch it with `catch` clause use `error`
or `assert` functions.

### Examples
Catch all errors, ignore those and return fallback value:

``` fennel
(fn add [x y]
  (try
    (+ x y)
    (catch _ 0)))

(assert-eq (add nil 1) 0)
```

Catch error and do cleanup:

``` fennel
(local tbl [])

(try
  (table.insert tbl "a")
  (table.insert tbl "b" "c")
  (catch _
    (each [k _ (pairs tbl)]
      (tset tbl k nil))))

(assert-eq (length tbl) 0)

```

Always run some side effect action:

``` fennel
(local t [])
(local res (try 10 (finally (table.insert t :finally))))
(assert-eq (. t 1) :finally)
(assert-eq res 10)

(local res (try (error 10) (catch 10 nil) (finally (table.insert t :again))))
(assert-eq (. t 2) :again)
(assert-eq res nil)
```

## `lazy-seq`
Function signature:

```
(lazy-seq & body)
```

Takes a `body` of expressions that returns a sequence, table or nil,
and yields a lazy sequence that will invoke the body only the first
time `seq` is called, and will cache the result and return it on all
subsequent `seq` calls. See also - `realized?`

## `lazy-cat`
Function signature:

```
(lazy-cat & colls)
```

Expands to code which yields a lazy sequence of the concatenation of
`colls` - expressions returning collections.  Each expression is not
evaluated until it is needed.

## `apply`
Function signature:

```
(apply ([f args]) ([f a args]) ([f a b args]) ([f a b c args]) ([f a b c d & args]))
```

Apply `f` to the argument list formed by prepending intervening
arguments to `args`, and `f` must support variadic amount of
arguments.

### Examples
Applying `add` to different amount of arguments:

``` fennel
(assert-eq (apply add [1 2 3 4]) 10)
(assert-eq (apply add 1 [2 3 4]) 10)
(assert-eq (apply add 1 2 3 4 5 6 [7 8 9]) 45)
```

## `add`
Function signature:

```
(add ([]) ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b c]) ([a b c d]) ([a b c d & rest]))
```

Sum arbitrary amount of numbers.

## `sub`
Function signature:

```
(sub ([]) ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b c]) ([a b c d]) ([a b c d & rest]))
```

Subtract arbitrary amount of numbers.

## `mul`
Function signature:

```
(mul ([]) ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b c]) ([a b c d]) ([a b c d & rest]))
```

Multiply arbitrary amount of numbers.

## `div`
Function signature:

```
(div ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b c]) ([a b c d]) ([a b c d & rest]))
```

Divide arbitrary amount of numbers.

## `le`
Function signature:

```
(le ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b & [c d & more]]))
```

Returns true if nums are in monotonically non-decreasing order

## `lt`
Function signature:

```
(lt ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b & [c d & more]]))
```

Returns true if nums are in monotonically decreasing order

## `ge`
Function signature:

```
(ge ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b & [c d & more]]))
```

Returns true if nums are in monotonically non-increasing order

## `gt`
Function signature:

```
(gt ([a]) ([a b]) ([a b & [c d & more]]))
```

Returns true if nums are in monotonically increasing order

## `inc`
Function signature:

```
(inc [x])
```

Increase number `x` by one

## `dec`
Function signature:

```
(dec [x])
```

Decrease number `x` by one

## `eq`
Function signature:

```
(eq ([]) ([_]) ([a b]) ([a b & cs]))
```

Comparison function.

Accepts arbitrary amount of values, and does the deep comparison.  If
values implement `__eq` metamethod, tries to use it, by checking if
first value is equal to second value, and the second value is equal to
the first value.  If values are not equal and are tables does the deep
comparison.  Tables as keys are supported.

## `map?`
Function signature:

```
(map? [x])
```

Check whether `x` is an associative table.

Non-empty tables are tested by calling `next`. If the length of the
table is greater than zero, the last integer key is passed to the
`next`, and if `next` returns a key, the table is considered
associative. If the length is zero, `next` is called with what `paris`
returns for the table, and if the key is returned, table is considered
associative.

Empty tables can't be analyzed with this method, and `map?` will
always return `false`.  If you need this test pass for empty table,
see `hash-map` for creating tables that have additional metadata
attached for this test to work.

### Examples
Non-empty map:

``` fennel
(assert-is (map? {:a 1 :b 2}))
```

Empty tables don't pass the test:

``` fennel
(assert-not (map? {}))
```

Empty tables created with `hash-map` will pass the test:

``` fennel
(assert-is (map? (hash-map)))
```

## `vector?`
Function signature:

```

```

Check whether `tbl` is a sequential table.

Non-empty sequential tables are tested for two things:
- `next` returns the key-value pair,
- key, that is returned by the `next` is equal to `1`.

Empty tables can't be analyzed with this method, and `vector?` will
always return `false`.  If you need this test pass for empty table,
see `vector` for creating tables that have additional
metadata attached for this test to work.

### Examples
Non-empty vector:

``` fennel
(assert-is (vector? [1 2 3 4]))
```

Empty tables don't pass the test:

``` fennel
(assert-not (vector? []))
```

Empty tables created with `vector` will pass the test:

``` fennel
(assert-is (vector? (vector)))
```

## `multifn?`

## `reduce`
Function signature:

```

```

`f` should be a function of 2 arguments. If `val` is not supplied,
returns the result of applying `f` to the first 2 items in `coll`,
then applying `f` to that result and the 3rd item, etc. If `coll`
contains no items, f must accept no arguments as well, and reduce
returns the result of calling `f` with no arguments.  If `coll` has
only 1 item, it is returned and `f` is not called.  If `val` is
supplied, returns the result of applying `f` to `val` and the first
item in `coll`, then applying `f` to that result and the 2nd item,
etc. If `coll` contains no items, returns `val` and `f` is not
called. Early termination is supported via `reduced`.

### Examples

``` fennel
(defn- add
  ([] 0)
  ([a] a)
  ([a b] (+ a b))
  ([a b & cs] (apply add (+ a b) cs)))
;; no initial value
(assert-eq 10 (reduce add [1 2 3 4]))
;; initial value
(assert-eq 10 (reduce add 1 [2 3 4]))
;; empty collection - function is called with 0 args
(assert-eq 0 (reduce add []))
(assert-eq 10.3 (reduce math.floor 10.3 []))
;; collection with a single element doesn't call a function unless the
;; initial value is supplied

(assert-eq 7 (reduce add 3 [4]))
```

## `reduced`
Function signature:

```
(reduced [value])
```

           (reduce (fn [acc x]
                     (if (not= :number (type x))
                         (reduced :NaN)
                         (+ acc x)))

```

## `reduce-kv`
Function signature:

```
(reduce-kv [f val s])
```

`f` should be a function of 3 arguments.  Returns the result of
applying `f` to `val`, the first key and the first value in `tbl`,
then applying `f` to that result and the 2nd key and value, etc.  If
`tbl` contains no entries, returns `val` and `f` is not called.  Note
that `reduce-kv` is supported on sequential tables and strings, where
the keys will be the ordinals.

Early termination is possible with the use of `reduced`
function.

### Examples

          :b1 2
          :a2 2
          :b2 3})

## `lazy-seq*`
Function signature:

```
(lazy-seq* [f])
```

Create lazy sequence from the result of calling a function `f`.

automates the process of function creation.

## `line-seq`
Function signature:

```
(line-seq [file])
```

Accepts a `file` handle, and creates a lazy sequence of lines using
`lines` metamethod.

### Examples

Lazy sequence of file lines may seem similar to an iterator over a
file, but the main difference is that sequence can be shared onve
realized, and iterator can't.  Lazy sequence can be consumed in
iterator style with the `doseq` macro.

Bear in mind, that since the sequence is lazy it should be realized or
truncated before the file is closed:

``` fennel
(let [lines (with-open [f (io.open "cljlib.fnl" :r)]
              (line-seq f))]
  ;; this will error because only first line was realized, but the
  ;; file was closed before the rest of lines were cached
  (assert-not (pcall next lines)))
```

Sequence is realized with `doall` before file was closed and can be shared:

``` fennel
(let [lines (with-open [f (io.open "cljlib.fnl" :r)]
              (doall (line-seq f)))]
  (assert-is (pcall next lines)))
```

Infinite files can't be fully realized, but can be partially realized
with `take`:

``` fennel
(let [lines (with-open [f (io.open "/dev/urandom" :r)]
              (doall (take 3 (line-seq f))))]
  (assert-is (pcall next lines)))
```

```

## `list*`

`f` should accept number-of-colls arguments. Returns a transducer when
no collection is provided.

### Examples

``` fennel
(map #(+ $ 1) [1 2 3]) ;; => @seq(2 3 4)
(map #(+ $1 $2) [1 2 3] [4 5 6]) ;; => @seq(5 7 9)

```

Given a map of replacement pairs and a vector/collection `coll`,
returns a vector/seq with any elements `=` a key in `smap` replaced

## `rseq`
Function signature:

```
(rseq [rev])
```

Returns, in possibly-constant time, a seq of the items in `rev` in reverse order.
Input must be traversable with `ipairs`.  Doesn't work in constant
time if `rev` implements a linear-time `__len` metamethod, or invoking
Lua `#` operator on `rev` takes linar time.  If `t` is empty returns
`nil`.

## `sequence`
Function signature:

```
(sequence ([coll]) ([xform coll]) ([xform coll & colls]))

Coerces coll to a (possibly empty) sequence, if it is not already
one. Will not force a lazy seq. `(sequence nil)` yields an empty list,
When a transducer `xform` is supplied, returns a lazy sequence of
applications of the transform to the items in `coll`, i.e. to the set
of first items of each `coll`, followed by the set of second items in
each `coll`, until any one of the `colls` is exhausted.  Any remaining

supplied, `f` will be called to produce it. `f` should be a reducing
step function that accepts both 1 and 2 arguments, if it accepts only
2 you can add the arity-1 with `completing`. Returns the result of
applying (the transformed) `xform` to `init` and the first item in
`coll`, then applying `xform` to that result and the 2nd item, etc. If
`coll` contains no items, returns `init` and `f` is not called. Note
that certain transforms may inject or skip items.

## `transient`
Function signature:

```
(transient [coll])
```

Returns a new, transient version of the collection.

## `tree-seq`
Function signature:

```
(tree-seq [branch? children root])
```

Returns a lazy sequence of the nodes in a tree, via a depth-first walk.

`branch?` must be a function of one arg that returns true if passed a
node that can have children (but may not).  `children` must be a
function of one arg that returns a sequence of the children.  Will
only be called on nodes for which `branch?` returns true.  `root` is
the root node of the tree.

### Examples

For the given tree `["A" ["B" ["D"] ["E"]] ["C" ["F"]]]`:

        A
       / \
      B   C
     / \   \
    D   E   F

Calling `tree-seq` with `next` as the `branch?` and `rest` as the
`children` returns a flat representation of a tree:

``` fennel
(assert-eq (map first (tree-seq next rest ["A" ["B" ["D"] ["E"]] ["C" ["F"]]]))
           ["A" "B" "D" "E" "C" "F"])
```

## `unreduced`
Function signature:

```
(unreduced [x])
```

If `x` is `reduced?`, returns `(deref x)`, else returns `x`.

## `update`
Function signature:

```
(update [tbl key f])
```

Update table value stored under `key` by calling a function `f` on
that value. `f` must take one argument, which will be a value stored
under the key in the table.

### Examples

Same as `assoc` but accepts function to produce new value based on key value.

``` fennel
(assert-eq
 {:data "THIS SHOULD BE UPPERCASE"}
 (update {:data "this should be uppercase"} :data string.upper))
```

## `update-in`
Function signature:

```
(update-in [tbl key-seq f])
```

given `key-seq` by calling a function `f` on the value stored under the
last key.  `f` must take one argument, which will be a value stored
under the key in the table.  Returns a new immutable table.

### Examples

Same as `assoc-in` but accepts function to produce new value based on key value.

``` fennel
(fn capitalize-words [s]
  (pick-values 1
    (s:gsub "(%a)([%w_`]*)" #(.. ($1:upper) ($2:lower)))))

(assert-eq
 {:user {:name "John Doe"}}
 (update-in {:user {:name "john doe"}} [:user :name] capitalize-words))
```

## `vec`
Function signature:

```
(vec [coll])
```
